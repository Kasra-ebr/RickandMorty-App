## ‚úÖ Functional Components using React Hooks

- **Why it's separate**: This emphasizes that the project follows the modern React approach of using functional components instead of class-based components. **React Hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) are used to handle state and side effects in functional components, which is a more declarative and concise way of writing React components.

---

## ‚úÖ DRY Principles and Reusable UI

- **Why it's separate**: This section highlights the importance of keeping the code **clean, maintainable**, and **efficient**. **DRY** stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," a principle that encourages avoiding code duplication. Instead of repeating logic, reusable UI components are created, making the code more modular and easier to update or scale.

---

## ‚úÖ Context API for Global State

- **Why it's separate**: The **Context API** is a powerful tool for managing and sharing state across multiple components in a React application. Instead of passing props down through multiple layers of components (which can become cumbersome), the **Context API** is used to maintain a **global state** that can be accessed anywhere in the app. This is especially helpful for data like user authentication, app settings, or, in this case, **characters**, **episodes**, and **favourites**.

---

## ‚úÖ Separation of UI and Logic

- **Why it's separate**: This describes the **architectural** approach taken in the app. Keeping **UI** (view-related code) and **business logic** (data-fetching, state management) in separate parts of the app helps with **modularity**, **reusability**, and **testability**. For example:
  - UI components only care about displaying data.
  - Logic (e.g., fetching characters from an API, managing state) is abstracted away in custom hooks or context, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

---

## ‚úÖ Reusable Button, Modal, and Character Components

- **Why it's separate**: This points to the **UI components** that have been made **reusable** to avoid redundancy in the code. For example:
  - **Button** component: A reusable button that can be customized for any use case.
  - **Modal** component: A general-purpose modal dialog that can display different content.
  - **Character** component: A component designed to display character details.

These components are **not hardcoded** for a specific part of the app instead, they can be used in various parts of the application by passing in different props.
